0," Toronto, ON ", 2 November 2020,Financial Advisor,4.0,A Great Place to Start Your Career in Financial Services,"If you are just out of school or finishing a degree, Scotiabank is a great place to learn the fundamentals of customer service and financial products."
1," Montréal, QC ", 23 June 2021,Agent de perception,1.0,Poor management ,"Poor management and leadership, one team leader say something and the other one says otherwise, very disappointed. A lot of favouritism towards teamlead friends. When you have a question nobody knows the answer. The teamlead doesn’t care, doesn’t provide you with the right info and then penalizes you. quality department protocol very ununfaire and looks for anything to penalize agents. The job itself is easy, the real problem is the management I do not recommend this job."
2," Calgary, AB ", 12 June 2021,Customer Service Representative,1.0,This corporation is the devil - do not work here,"I worked as CSR and it was the worst job I've ever had in customer service. Management is completely in it for themselves and do not care at all about their employees. The training is very very minimal and you are expected to learn a complicated system all on your own, then get blamed for when you mess up. Horrible place to be in I was bullied and shamed for not knowing things in front of my colleagues and customers!! Horrible work culture and they don't even car about their clients. They just want their money and to sell as much as they can to clients when they don't need it."
3," Sackville, NB ", 9 June 2021,Scotiabank Senior Financial Advisor,1.0,"Poor management, bad support teams no work life balance ","Thave been working for 15 years including 4 companies and 2 banks and scotiabank is by  a wide margin the worst. No support , zero training , no work life balance , systems always crashing and out of date shocking given the bank reports. Billion dollar profits could write 1000 page book about why this is a terrible company to work for   My only advise to anyone applying or thinking about banking with scotiabank is run the other way"
4," Trenton, ON ", 7 June 2021,Financial Advisor,1.0,Toxic envirnoment,The culture in this bank was toxic for myself and several others I know at other locations. This bank only cares about sales not the clients best interest. I've worked at 2 other bigger banks that were hard targets but healthy culture. 
5, Operations Support (Former Employee) , 44 King Street West ,Support Officer Support and Administrative Services - Operations Support,5.0,"Considerate, organized","I've worked at Scotiabank for 20 years.  Loved all the departments I've worked at.  Staff very supportive.  New tasks or courses allows you to grow.  Award programs and bonuses in place.  Due to family reasons, moved away from Downtown Toronto and my job was not tranferable... I miss the people I worked with over the years.  Great company to work for!"
6," Toronto, ON ", 2 May 2021,Client Administrator,1.0,Worst experience of my life,"I spent all of 5 months at Scotiabank but by the first month I knew it wasn’t a good place to work. I was a client administrator that came in on a 6 month contract that could be made permanent at the end of the contract. First off, the training is horrible. They give you a run through for 2 weeks then you’re on your own. I actually didn’t mind that, but when you asked someone for help they acted as if you should already know. If you made a mistake the “team lead (s)” and the manager would make you feel like trash. The manager was absolutely no help, treated us like high school students, and talked down to us all the time and yes you do have to suck up, be a know it all, etc. It was such a toxic environment. Also, Scotiabank is so cheap and they treat their employees like bums. Plus we had to physically come in to a depressing office daily during the pandemic when literally all of our work was digital and could have been done remotely. In total, this was the worst work experience of my life, but I’m glad I had this experience so I know what to avoid in the future. "
7," Grande Prairie, AB ", 23 April 2021,Customer Representative,2.0,"If you want to have a second job, work here.","I worked for Scotiabank for 3 years and received less than $1 increase in salary over those 3 years. It wasn't because I wasn't good at my job. I received the ""best of the best"" award twice while working there. They do not have full time customer representative positions available so don't expect to ever make enough money to live. I always had to have a second job to make enough to actually pay for things I needed. Their benefits are decent and I did really enjoy the people I worked with. But as a company who's CEO made millions last year, I'd say they pay their employees like absolute garbage. I recently was offered a job from a credit union and was offered $7 more per hour as a starting salary!! Just goes to show how much Scotiabank doesn't care about making sure they're employees actually make a living wage."
8," Toronto, ON ", 20 April 2021,Project Leader,1.0,Not very good place to work.,"If you got job here after your long search, do not stick for a longer time. Very very slow career growth.Upper management is not ready to listen to your suggestions."
9," Ottawa, ON ", 14 April 2021,Customer Care Advisor,1.0,Horrible place to work with no seniority status.,"Scotia contact center is an awful place to work.  You are only a number that gains NOTHING with seniority other then an extra week off work.  The new hires make more then the tenured employee!  Would you want to come to work everyday knowing your just a number and mean nothing to them?? Vacation requests are on a first come first served basis, so a tenured agent who is off that day, gets shafted due to the fact that a new hire requested first!!"
10," Tillsonburg, ON ", 5 April 2021,Customer Service Representative,2.0,Ok,There was only 2 of us on contracted because at the time they never hire or took forever to get hired on at Xmas all the staff got a bonus but us 2 on contract made us feel terrible no one cared lol was a total joke bunch of jerks 
11," Toronto, ON ", 2 April 2021,Manager,1.0,Nightmare ,"The environment is toxic.  You can’t trust your leadership.  Everyone is out for themselves and staff are worked to the point of exhaustion where it affects their mental health.  They do not accommodate for disabilities and treat you like you don’t matter.  If you ask for help or support, it is turned around on you that you can’t do your job.  It was a horrible place to work.  I gave them my heart and they took my soul."
12," Bridgewater, NS ", 27 March 2021,Financial Advisor,1.0,Toxic Work Environment,Manager has no connection to employees and consistently downplays achievements or twists everything into a negative statement. Manager strives to bring out the worst in the employees to feed their own ego.
13, Quebec Province , 22 March 2021,Gestion des avoir et spécialiste des placements,1.0,Not recommended ,"Even if you are sales machine, you will be exhausted, and you will never have a life balance.Horrible Human Resources. You should be more careful with your income taxes."
14, British Columbia , 17 March 2021,Small Business Advisor,1.0,Use it as a placeholder,"Decent pay, but no increments in pay should be expected as it wont happen. No support from management, stressful environment is created and unreasonable expectations is a norm, favourism, fakism very common. Use it as a placeholder and move on"
15," Halifax, NS ", 15 March 2021,VSBA,1.0,Very streessful and demanding job,6 branches with 6 branch managers to deal with it. It's hard to meet the goal. The managers'll not promote you for new jobs and skills. It's a dead end jobs!!! 
16," Toronto, ON ", 10 March 2021,Senior ETL Developer,5.0,Excellent place to work,Scotiabank is an excellent place to work where you have a lot of room for growth and self development.Work environment is very good too. Team was so good and collaboration was the key.
17, Nova Scotia , 8 March 2021,Customer Service/Cashier,1.0,Terrible workplace,"Terrible workplace, no pros. Very poor management and job culture in  every branch. The worst coworkers I've ever had, rolling eyes at customers and coworkers. I wouldn't recommend this place to my worst enemy. "
18," Calgary, AB ", 3 March 2021,Financial Advisor,1.0,Do not Recommend (see why below),very low payno work like balancethey say they are all about diversity and inclusion but they do NOT even know the meaning of diversity AND inclusion. All about sales but then also want you to do the right thing?i would not recommend this companyThey say they have departments to help employees but when you call its like you are running in circles...no one knows the answers....very long and confusing policies..no clear answer...so many steps to get ONE SIMPLE solution. 
19," Mississauga, ON ", 1 March 2021,Administrative Assistant,4.0,Sales Oriented,I loved working there however banking had become a sales environment. I am not a sales person. I worked there 25 years ago so do not know current conditions and procedures. 
20," Ottawa, ON ", 25 February 2021,Senior Financial Advisor,3.0,Culture of the 1950s,"Management weak, salary level poor, micromanaged, hard to find many positives.  Some parts of management very unprofessional.  Other banks better and more progressive."
21," Toronto, ON ", 2 November 2020,Financial Advisor,4.0,A Great Place to Start Your Career in Financial Services,"If you are just out of school or finishing a degree, Scotiabank is a great place to learn the fundamentals of customer service and financial products."
22, Brand Management and Creative Services (Former Employee) , 100 Yonge Street ,Production Manager - Brand Management and Creative Services,3.0,"Great co-workers, horrible management","The bank has struggled to meet the digital world.  The focus has shifted from employee to stock returns.  The bank wanted complete devotion to the company, yet has no interest in the welfare of its employees.  Managers and departments are pitted against each others in the false notion of competition is good among employees.  Every manager just worries about the christmas bonus, thats all that is important internally."
23, Canada , 15 February 2021,Financial Advisor,3.0,Really Depends on Location,"Working at Scotiabank had its ups and downs. The Financial Advisor position had far too many goals and tasks that it was very hard to do what was asked of you, meanwhile getting little pay. Management can make or break the position, and it really varies on location. It is a good entry level position, but too stressful for me to stay for long. I've heard the Customer Service positions are much better, though. "
24, Saskatoon , 12 February 2021,Financial Advisor,4.0,Aggressive targets ,They aren't afraid to fire people if they are not performing. Not a bad employer but they are not very flexible. Somewhat limited by technology. I would work there again.
25," Kelowna, BC ", 10 February 2021,Universal Banker,2.0,Unfortunately it’s all about numbers,"I worked for this company for nearly 7 years in numerous positions. Every year it’s getting worse. The stress and pressure for FA are tremendous. Every day u have meeting about targets, calls. When u reach one u get scold for the other you didn’t  reach. They closed mid office back in the day, who provided the admin support and it’s well needed . The FA have no time to do all in 7.5h. They paid poorly for the amount of work they need to be done. The front staff ,tellers are above $2 min wage and have so much on their shoulders. If any of them make a mistake regarding policy they will receive conduct letter ( 3 strikes and out). All of us were asking to get increase we were told, no increase, now they changing front positions with more things to do without compensation. The way how it’s managed it’s poor and it’s all goes from the top. Otherwise people are great to work with,  we are all in the same boat, depressed and frustrated. I Do not recommend this company most of my coworkers are on stress leave or quit. "
26," Calgary, AB ", 5 February 2021,Teller; Supervisor Level,4.0,Overall good,Excellent and professional work culture and environment. Work and be overloaded and stressful at times. Management is excellent with lost of advancement opportunities. Several employee and support programs. One of the best environments to work in.
27, Uptown Waterloo branch , 28 January 2021,Cashier and Customer Service,5.0,Excellent work place and co workers are like a family very much understanding ,Excellent work place and my team worker are all amazing people like a small family very much understanding and helpful. All Manager at uptown waterloo branch are the best people to work with. Thank for giving me and opportunity. Only the amount of work you do the salary is not that great. 
28," Thunder Bay, ON ", 27 January 2021,Customer Service Representative,5.0,Workplace is fast paced ,If you are a teller you can get busy and overloaded with work. For advisors. A lot of customers come to the branch daily. The staff and management are good. 
29," St. John's, NL ", 27 January 2021,Financial Advisor,1.0,Mirco managers, Management high turn over . High turn over in staff . Current manager is not motivating. All they do is repeat what we need to do .Current management mirco management is very counterproductive. We don’t need meetings about meetings. Depending on the location/ branch you will move / advance. If your in a failing branch you won’t advance. Even if your succeeding as no one to fill your position. Benefits good . Men make more with this employer . Not equal pay employer .
30," Calgary, AB ", 26 January 2021,Financial Advisor,2.0,Decent Company,Company is about sales. They tell you do the right thing and don't force people but then push for sales. They say they are big on diversity but I didn't see that. It's one thing to say it and another to actually do something about it. My manager was good but things above got me to leave. Maybe sales is not my thing. Salary is very low compared to other banks and lenders.
31," Edmonton, AB ", 26 January 2021,Customer Service Representative,4.0,Very friendly staff..more like a family,Does not pay very well but benefits are good..not enough hours to pay bills. Since covid part-time hours only available because bank has shorter hours
32," Calgary, AB ", 18 January 2021,Customer Service Representative,2.0,Does not value casual employees,"Worked for Scotia for close to 7 years, and was making only 10 cents more than my starting wage due to a switch in provinces and casual employees not being eligible for wage increases. Benefits while permanent are great. Management varied greatly from branch to branch. Some are very well organized, and others require overtime to finish the day, but is rarely paid out because branch managers think things should be done quicker. As a result, closing activities sometimes took place in an unsafe matter, or before the doors were locked, which created a security risk that often went unnoticed. Management was occasionally incompetent due to the practice of promoting people out of the branch to get rid of them, rather than firing them. "
33," Bonavista, NL ", 14 January 2021,Customer Service Representative,1.0,Lack of management ,"Sadly the management and favouritism is lacking. I love the customers and enjoyed that aspect, and the financial officers were great but the culture in that location was awful! The Lack of training, and management made it for a very sad experience."
34," Toronto, Ontario ", 11 January 2021,Premises Manager,5.0,Great success all around,Successfully ensured the smooth running of the premises on Toronto. All the health and safety check were exceeded. Proper and effective risk assessment were successfully implemented. I was absolutely perfect at my job. 
35," Halifax, NS ", 5 January 2021,Bilingual Customer Service Representative,1.0,Don’t work here,"Don’t work there , management is no where to be found when in need of help and if they are they’ll leave you and tell you it’s not their problem . Customers are probably worse than management. They threaten you all day long you might get 5/150 calls that are good customers . Don’t waste your time the money is good but your mentality won’t be."
36," St. John's, NL ", 3 January 2021,Customer Relations Representative/CustomerService Supervisor,5.0,Productive and fun place to work even in the busy tones ,It was a fun place to work even though it was very busy place to work. We had lots of fun and got the work done . The staff were very friendly. Loved going to work everyday. 
37," Scarborough, ON ", 26 December 2020,Infrastructure/ Cloud Security Engineer,5.0,Very good environment ,I feel very comfortable and satisfied. The working environment is flexible and management is so good.I wish to work at Scotia bank again. Team lead and manager very much help full and coleage are helpfulVery good team.
38," Edmonton, AB ", 24 December 2020,Customer Representative,1.0,Not a great place to work at all,"In the 5+ years that I worked for Scotiabank, I can honestly say they don’t care about you as an employee, they only care about high value clients and their money. Some managers will only show respect to employees who are on their “good side” which means having to suck up to them all day, everyday. Job advancement is a joke as well within this company, you also need to be on the managers “good side” just to be considered for a better position, no matter how qualified you are. In the time I worked there as a CR, I was never late and worked really hard but only received in total maybe 65 cents in raises. As a CR you’re required to do a lot throughout the day, it is usually very stressful and definitely isn’t worth the amount of money you receive as a wage. Even HR pretends to care about you but they really don’t. You’re just a number to them. If the company makes a mistake with your hours or pay, they’ll take their sweet time fixing it but if there’s a mistake with a customers money they make sure they’re paid back the same day. This company doesn’t have its priorities straight at all. They expect their employees to go the extra mile in order to bring in as much customer money as possible but they aren’t willing to go the extra mile for their employees. If you work full time though the benefit and health spending account plans are pretty decent and help a lot with prescriptions and other expenses. That’s the only good thing I can think of though in regard to this company."
39," Halifax, NS ", 17 December 2020,Customer Service Officer,1.0,not a great place to work anymore,"It was fun to work there in the beginning looked like there was lots of advancement options, but so much competition for jobs depends on who your manager is and how they would help you get ahead. Very clicky and just stressful, very stressful no matter how much work you put into it, never seems like good enough."
40, Ontario , 15 December 2020,Client Advisor,2.0,"Good way for your foot in the door, but stressful and fast-paced","Good workplace if you’re looking for experience at a financial institution. Cal centre level there’s no managers around and you find things on your own like resources and help. Colleagues aren’t always helpful, very disorganized and overly secured company that hinders a successful call completion, and unrealistic expectations for targets you need to meet. Things you should’ve learned during training, you learn on the floor. Not a good place to stay, but a great way to learn about the financial industry and move on to something better. "
41," Scarborough, ON ", 7 December 2020,Mainframe Analyst Access Security,4.0,Great coworkers and management,"Good facility, friendly co-workers. Management acknowledgement at accomplishments. Good facility location easy transportation access. Easy senior management communication"
42," Toronto, ON ", 2 November 2020,Financial Advisor,4.0,A Great Place to Start Your Career in Financial Services,"If you are just out of school or finishing a degree, Scotiabank is a great place to learn the fundamentals of customer service and financial products."
43, Ottawa , 26 November 2020,Financial Advisor,1.0,Worst company,"Very stressful and no support from manager. They only care sales not employees at all. And bank don’t train FAs properly, they want them to start work as soon as possible to get sales for the bank. And so many FAs are doing a lot bad things for clients"
44," Toronto, ON ", 16 November 2020,Corporate Banking Analyst,1.0,Corporate Banking role in Toronto,Horrible management and culture with very long hours and low pay compared to the street. The corporate banking directors and managers think they are god's greatest gift to mankind. 
45, Mississauga , 13 November 2020,AML Investigator,3.0,Very stressed,The job it self is not so bad. The management is very tough on productivity  free overtime is required from time to time.   Job is very  tedious and boring.
46," Stratford, ON ", 13 November 2020,Senior Business Data Entry Analyst,5.0,amazing people to work with,best co workers ever and the job has many perks and nice things like if your not feeling good or sleepy they have a bed room like place to relax and refresh for better work performance and even the managers are amazing they always teach new techniques and how to better your performance and even have every 2 weeks to a month a special donation or contributing for different organizations and events to support this and that means a lot. im proud to have n=been part of this amazing environment.
47," Toronto, ON ", 9 November 2020,Customer Service Rep,5.0,Enjoyed every day ,I was lucky to work for Scotiabank Im thankful and appreciate a lot - I met a lot of great friendly people I did my best and help others  - team work is important give me satisfaction to expand my knowledge 
48," Toronto, ON ", 31 October 2020,Senior Agency and Loan Officer,5.0,Excellent ,"Outstanding company to work with. My carrier grow in this company. I was motivated to work with this company. If I have the opportunity to wo for this company again, I will happy to do it. "
49," Dartmouth, NS ", 27 October 2020,Bank Manager,1.0,Awful place to work for,I worked in banking for 10 years before joining the BNS. I have never had panic attacks before having to go to work as I did at BNS there is no support or training for new employees joining the team. 
50," Red Deer, AB ", 17 October 2020,"Scotiabank Service Advisor, Universal Banker",1.0,Management can be a nightmare,Management can be a nightmare if the wrong greedy bullies are in charge. Be careful. You are 100% a number with the bank. They don't care about you as a human. 
51," Ottawa, ON ", 12 October 2020,Customer Service Representative,3.0,Quality of life is very dependent on the branch you're at.,"I enjoyed my time at Scotiabank. My managers and co-workers for the most part were always pleasant to me. Regardless of your position, if you're in a retail branch you are expected to meet sales goals. These are often very high, borderline unreachable. Your advancement opportunities are limited, but they are available if you're willing to leave your town/province. This is also a benefit, since if you are looking to move provinces/towns, there is always a Scotiabank to move to. Their formal training is painfully bad, but if you get a good trainer, their hands-on training isn't awful. Pay is something people always complain about. You have high levels of responsibility, but aren't compensated for it. All in all, Scotiabank isn't the worst place to be. It's a good starting job if you have an interest in investing/looking for a part-time job through university or college, but long term? I am not so sure."
52," Toronto, ON ", 12 October 2020,Administrative Assistant/Bank Teller,4.0,Fun place to work and meet positive minded people. ,"Working at the bank is great until you colleagues start snitching on you and taking everything you say or do to the management. Managers encourage gossip and spreading of rumours like high school. It’s ridiculous and this makes the bank( my branch)  a very stressful environment to work. Your colleague always want to look good in front of managers so be careful what you say or do. You have no friends at work. Also if you get hired as casual or part time. Don’t expect to get more hours or change to permanent. Just get your experience and go to another bank. According to the work bankers do, they should get paid more than $16."
53," Toronto, Ca  ", 5 October 2020,Scrum Master (Remote),5.0,productive and fun work place with ping pong table,"It was a nice and awesome place to work , team collaboration , understanding , remove impediments, making sure everyone is on the same page and doing their job. More to that we deliver on time and have our meetings on time , layout our problems to the stakeholders and try to amend them in other to move forward . I do my best  to make sure all my team members are doing the job being assigned   to do by  coaching , facilitate , leading them to the right direction."
54, Canada , 30 September 2020,Client Solutions Advisor,2.0,"Lack of leadership, especially during covid","Terrible communication between departments. Just such a big company and no one talk to each other.  The. People that suffer are the clients. Benefits are good. Paid days are great, but I’ve never gone 24 hours without having to reply to emails and phone calls. Workload never ends. No work life balance. Management is not hired based on skill. Either you drink the kool-aid, are a child of a long time employee, or you go nowhere. Co workers can be very competitive and training is dismal.  I felt under qualified giving clients advise so soon. "
55," Mississauga, ON ", 30 September 2020,Customer Representative,5.0,Positive Work Culture,working for Scotia opened up my eyes to a positive banking work culture. Everyone works together and willing to help one another achieve a solution to any problem

58," Toronto, ON ", 14 September 2020,Digital Product Manager / Product owner,5.0,"Great place to work, lot to learn. People are extremely talented","Great place, a lot to learn. I had some really good learnings during my tenure. They really have a nice playful culture. Especially during COVID the org was very thoughtful, indulged staff in games and other activities. They provided $500 to everyone as healthcare benefits. They also supplied chairs to people and top management personally delivered it to staffs house. Top management has some ambiguity in defining the roadmap, but then it is a Bank, it has so many dependencies that it is nothing new or unexpected. Overall a great experience!"
59," Burlington, ON ", 31 August 2020,Financial Advisor,1.0,laid off 5 years ago,started off okay and went downhill got laid off wouldn't recommend. This was 5 years ago things may have changed if you get a good starting offer I would take it but I'd look elsewhere.
60," Oshawa, ON ", 28 August 2020,Customer Service Representative,1.0,Not very fair and management does not care about their staff,At first it was enjoyable and then things change and seems that with the constant change of managers it worsened.  Not very fair and not very truthful and just overall not happy there.  It's  all about making the customers happy and all about the image.  Manager does what she needs to do to get ahead no matter who he/she is stepping on 
61," Winnipeg, MB ", 25 August 2020,Mobile Mortgage Advisor,5.0,"Best of the big banks in Canada, no question. Major bank with a credit union feel. Would gladly work there again.","Excellent culture to work in, feels like you’re working at a credit union instead of a major financial institution. The customers are often well taken care of as are you"
62," Bath, NB ", 22 August 2020,Financial Advisor,4.0,Goal driven,Most rewarding part of the job is when you see customer getting financially literate and adept. Sales goal are realistic but comes with proactive calling which will have to be done even sales goal are exceeded.

64, Processing Support Centre (Former Employee) , Chaguanas ,Senior Processing Clerk - Processing Support Centre,4.0,Management,"Management dealt realistically with employees based on their performances. They recognized and appreciated when the need arose and when needed, they reprimanded to ensure we follow protocol and bank policies."
65," Vancouver, BC ", 2 August 2020,Customer Service Representative,3.0,"Fast path, stressful ","Today I am a Teller per se Customer Representative, if you not see yourself going in the path to become a Financial Advisor the job is not worth it. The role is really stressful, salary and hours are a joke. You will have to deal with a lot of responsibilities and not be paying well. Day by day, you will have to process payouts, property taxes, wills, estates, a lot of fraud cases and  thons of upset clients. I am luck I have a chance to work with nice people so sometimes days are ok, but being honest, after a year there, I am looking for another job."
66," Toronto, ON ", 29 July 2020,"Production Administrator, Production Creative & Production",4.0,fast paced but no stress or mental pressure at work,"worked for almost 14 years, 8 years as supervisor in fulfillment department, managing a staff of 10 people, fulfilling the requests of Sales and Marketing teams, all in house printing (brochures, leaflets etc) assembling sales kits and also storing promotional sales items, taking care of the inventory, also mail and courier the packages to different clients, advisors."
67," Surrey, BC ", 29 July 2020,Financial Advisor,5.0,Great place to work!,It’s been quite a learning at Scotiabank. Fast paced environment expected to plan ahead to be successful. Great mentor ship. Client focussed and gives you a chance to work for the community.
68, British Columbia , 26 July 2020,FINANCIAL ADVISOR,3.0,Good Place to get started. Poor Standards and Ethics,"Fine people, fine culture. Most of the people are nice, and management team respect employees.Compensation are fine--above market average, and good additional compensation. However,1) All the banks(not just Scotia) would never treat people equally and nicely unless you are rich. They all advocate that they treat people nicely and equally regardless of their nationality, race, economic status and occupations. That's a lie. 2) This is a Sales Role. It means that sales is everything. If you want to follow code of conduct, standards and ethics, you would never be successful. Sales is everything--again, all the banks are the same, not just Scotia(Scotia is actually comparatively better than its competitors regarding to this). 3) People are really nice and respect each other, and that holds to be true at 99% of the time. The 1% being left is that if the issue is related to their sales------You can spend 3 days to work for a customer in order to gain the customer's respect and trust; however, a senior would tell you that this customer has been assigned to other people when the customer is about to bring you big sales. Again, this job is all about sales. 4) You don't need a college degree, and you don't need to have any financial knowledge to do a sales role.

I had a good deal of control over the work I did, which was nice.  The nail in the coffin for me was the inability to improve processes. On multiple occasions I developed and tested better tools and processes only to have them actively suppressed by the leadership team. Meanwhile, we all had to endure rhetoric that encouraged us to innovate. Completely contradictory. Corporate doublespeak at every meeting--at every turn. A decent job turned sour by arbitrary or misused policy."

A reorg is when top level people are moved around and the people under them move to either other managers or into other teams.  In 2017 the reorgs turned into a nightmare.  People who had been with the Bank in high capacity moved into positions of say helpdesk.  You would go from building infrastructure utilizing your  skill set to being asked to log into phone queue to take calls on password resets.  How this is possible is beyond me.   Management had their own agenda.  Was a very stressful time for alot of people and management just made it worse. Hardest part of the job was all the reorgs.

Management have changed employees recognition events like the best of the best parties that used to be a celebration to all the employees after a long year of victories and defeats to only one congratulation email to high performer employee with a voucher for a free drink with a VP as a congratulation for a successful year.  The bank used to reward and protect their talent a lot more but now it seems they are more driven by delivery forgetting of the quality of the people that work on it.

They provide benefits, paid holidays/sick days, Employee Share Plan, Pension Plan, Performance Compensation/Awards etc. However, there are a few downfalls. The company does not care about the service team, and compensation proves that. It's nearly impossible for anyone on the service team to make a living - at my branch we have one teller who is 30 hr/wk, the rest are 22.5 and 18.5 - no set schedule, so you are expected to be available Mon-Saturday, all hours. It makes it next to impossible to get a second job to support yourself. Training is practically non-existent for service team as well. It is relatively easy to advance within the company if you have the right/supportive management team - which not all branches are equipped with. However if you find a good mentor - moving from service to sales, to management, to out of branch is relatively easy, and they will help you get to where you want to go. Moving within branches, province to province, etc is also, in theory, easy to do. The sales team does have sales targets despite how they word it. I have seen many sales team members off on stress leave. Lots of pressure from the district to perform."

However, like many large financial institutions, it is entrenched internally while at the same time tries to present a progressive face to the public through marketing. It's a big ship and is slow to turn around. Upper management is often inadequate and usually illustrates the Peter Principle a little too well. Like many organizations, it's a ""yes-man"" culture with cliques that can hinder both performance and advancement. You need to be in a centralized main branch in a larger city to experience real career growth and professional development, but you also need to be prepared to fully ""drink the Koolaid"".

On par with call centres but not financial institutions. The software is old, theres a disconnect between senior management who think everything is the fault of the front line staff and the front line staff that take the big hits. Customer surveys are there and they are relied heavily on for bonuses. Half the time the surveys are not for the correct person and coaching is a joke because the managers are mostly lazy, The younger ones are driven and the senior ones are settled and not willing to even call customers back, It has many problems with keeping up with OFI's on a tech/pay basis and they dont seem concerned with turnover.

There are more directors than employees and none can make sensible decisions. Management is weak and ineffective. No leadership.  There is a culture of fear, as if you make one mistake you get fired, so managers stay put. Talent and initiative are discouraged: if you know more than your peers or manager, you get immediately pushed aside and removed from your duties, then deemed useless and eventually let go.  Their open office locations are like anthills where everybody runs all the time to find a spot to sit as there are no set desks. It's like a huge picnic area with no privacy. If you leave your laptop on a table for 30 seconds while going to the washrooms you are severely reprimanded for failing the security standards!

Instead management hiring from outside, people from other banks, just to get to know how other banks operate. All the management uses them like a knowledge base. All current internal staff are squeezed at max for their sales and then trown away as garbage and never appreciated. Everybody in the branch gets affected by the branch reviews. So even if you had no issues, but the rest of the team did, you get dinged as well.. .Sometimes up to 30-35% of your annual bonus - nice way to cut expenses. So if you want to get stuck for the same position for quite a quite a while then welcome to Scotiabank. Everything else is OK, not great. Salaryand benefits are average, work-life - average.

Micro management is the worse that I have ever experienced. Sales goals are set to where it nearly impossible and if you do not meet them, you can be put on notice. The banks are about lending money to people that will struggle to pay it back, banks make the money on interest. It is not customer focused, and what is right for the client, it is what will make the bank the most money. It is a culture of cliches, and constant battle. You are called out in front of other employees for humiliation, management is not there to be supportive or to train and mentor, it is all about the bonuses for Branch Managers, not what one would expect."
495," Delta, BC ", 26 August 2019,Financial Advisor,1.0,Stressful and Disorganized,"Scotiabank uses outdated technology, invokes pressure to make sales, and has extremely high turnover. the management team is also under pressure and this leads to micromanagement and controlling behaviour.

I really got along with my co-workers.  They have an outdated system from the 80s, the type which requires you to enter values in obsolete fields and press buttons just to be able to navigate from page to page, let alone everything else you have to do with it. Then I got voluntold to train to handle corporate accounts and that system is even more dated, requiring you to enter a long string of code just to log in repeatedly throughout the day. Not to mention, you have to be going back between systems. You do not get even a thank you for adding systems and skills to your already high call volume.  We had to manage our own schedules and submit all our hours, while taking back to back calls, doing case work, adding notes after the call. It was worse for my boss who confessed that he had to come in, in secret, after hours just to finish all of his work. Their resources should be consolidated and made more searchable.Their systems and resources take ten minutes to set up before you actually start working. Consultants have a serious attitude problem, many were condescending and snarky. One lady in our team was actually told by her boss, that the other team managers didn't think she was going to last long, needless to say she had a break down and left not long after that. She was an older lady and had her struggles, I admit,  but she was really giving it her all.  I could go on, and on, and on... suffice to say 50% of the people that were hired with me left within a year.

Be it from the Tellers to the Financial Advisers and that's why there is a HUGE turnover rate. The solutions they offer are very competitive, but upper management really has to take a look at LIVING WAGES and set wages based on region of the country, not just blanket the entire country in 1 generic bracket."

They are customer focused which is important; less complaints/nagging from the customer. The technology is way behind compared to other banks.

It was always about the bank’s bottom line and never about how we can truly help the client. They forced us to sell credit cards to people who already had a few cards and push insurance even though they would not qualify if something happened.  Benefits are the worst in my professional career and life and work balance: only when you are dead. My daughter had pneumonia and I told my manager about this and that I needed to take the rest of the week off (two days).

564," Toronto, ON ", 9 July 2019,Financial Advisor,3.0,Scotiabank top management  should take a close look at the CCC,Awful management in the contact center. No transparency with regards to goals and objectives. Staff turnover is high and morale is low.  Middle managers only watch their backs-- apparently a motto for those who survive here- so they  don't really  care for their staff even if they always  say they do.  The organization is also littered with petty middle-aged  ladies who will ask  staff to apologize for having a bottle of lotion on their table because they are sooo afraid the scent will trigger their allergies. Honestly these ladies should just enjoy an early retirement and give the bright new recruits a chance to shine.  Time to end the toxic environment!

568, 4 king street west , 7 July 2019,"Manager, Global Compliance",1.0,Toxic culture in global compliance - read this before you accept offer!,"Poor management. Poor treatment of people. The VPs and Directors think of themselves as VIPs and people aren’t treated with respect. They expect you to ‘prove’ yourself and the mistrust is quite evident hence micro management. And without delegation when the work gets too much for seniors or they drop the ball on something, they’ll come back to you and say ‘its your responsibility!’  Titles matter a lot. There are people here from third world countries who haven’t been properly integrated into the Canadian labour market and apparently aren’t even aware of harassment laws or social norms and are in powerful positions. There is an unstructured organizational structure, no coaching, especially at the lower level, and you are expected to be ‘proactive’ even though you don’t really have any information or decision making power. If you are at the manager level, you will be treated like a child who doesn’t know what they’re doing, but yet pressured and made to feel inadequate constantly. I was there for a few months and it was the worst experience. The stress made me physically ill and I was admitted to the hospital once and took a day off to which my manager gave me a lecture about ‘trust’ (implying that I had missed an important meeting and broken their trust’. I urge you to do your research, ask a lot of questions during the interview and better yet, accept any other offer you might have. I ignored the warning signs during the interview stage which led to this bad experience."

I only lasted 2 months after training as I had trouble keeping up with the pace of the calls and working at the pace the costumers expected. I also had difficulty verifying the customers every time and that got me in trouble. If you like banking right and following every Scotiabank procedure and value, then it's the right place for you. It can be a good career move if you want to work at Scotiabank part time and save to pay for school.

Management is extreme in favouritism. You can advance your career quickly but you have a small time frame to pass your exams-which are at your expense. They’re phasing out tellers in the next 10 years because they will have everything cash wise done by computers.They’re also extremely old fashioned and do everything on paper which is harmful for the environment. Also; the worst part is unless you’re management OR an account manager you will not get fulltime.I ended up quitting because of harassment from management."

Managers only become managers because of inside alliances & friendships in corporate positions. There are 2 good managers as far as I’m aware during my working life. One of them is retired who was my previous manager and treat my fair. My coworkers are very nice just the new manager. During I am working, the manager always pushes me on the position all the time. EX: when we only have two tellers in the front, the manager was chatting with another teller and only me working in the front and I even cannot leave to the washroom. When negotiating with managers to promote, they will catch your mistakes like months ago to say no. They ask will be perfect and no mistakes happen (even I didn't all my cx name one time because I do not know how to pronounce and also lines up in the front). The manager did not coach once a week but will ask you to do everything right. The rule was made by the manager like cash releasing, and they can change all the time. Almost my old coworkers were left because the new manager came in. The last salary was not right and the manager has discrimination on me. The main branch in Toronto must come to do another review not just interview with everybody. Scotia will not be my choice anymore."

The level of micromanaging, negligence with employees, and incompetence among managers is appalling. Human Resources takes 5+ days to respond to inquiries (after promising 1 day response times) and take 45+ minutes to answer the phone - and trust me, you’ll be calling them a lot. Pay was incorrect multiple times, managers only become managers because of inside alliances & CHILDHOOD friendships or siblings working in the corporate positions. There are 2 good managers as far as I’m aware out of the dozens the contact centre has. Managers are known to pressure people to return from medical leave. Heavy sales targets for regular customer service reps and systems constantly failing. Not to mention that there are essentially no protections in place for reps who take aggressive customer calls. People are known to have come off of bad calls crying and management puts them back on the phone. Even had one of my coworkers assaulted with racist remarks by a customer and had to continue taking calls in fear of loss of pay. Over half of my training group (8 people, to be specific) have quit in under a year and I know at least 10 people on stress leave. Do. Not. Work. Here."

One manager I had would cherry-pick leads and clients (i.e. prospective sales) and take them off 1 advisers calendar and give them to her favorites. After staff have been there for 10+ years they have a sense of ""you can't fire me"" and leadership (district & regional VPs) leave them alone."

As a Customer Representative I made just above minimum wage and managed a lot of physical cash. The training is awful, it does not prepare you for the job, and Management is non-supportive. Benefits themselves were actually pretty good. Vacation time was very basic. You can't take sick or personal days before you have been there over 3 months."
689, Alberta , 4 March 2019,Customer Service Representative/Teller,4.0,Inclusive Workplace,Scotiabank is a very inclusive workplace.  They are sensitive to their employees needs.  The pay is not that great when you are starting out but the benefits make up for that.

I don't know how they could stand being there for that long.  if you were working on something for a customer and they hung up before you finished you would just stop what you were doing and take the next call because Scotiabanks stats mean more to them than their customer. So if you didn't do a customers request in time they would give you a poor survey which you get penilized for. It's a backwards system. A friend of mine and I both worked there, and we both had to leave, my anxiety was so high I was in the bathroom every 5 minutes because it would trigger my IBS. Some managers are okay but most are VERY hard on their agents. If you want to move up, the only way you can is if you have perfect stats and become friends with someone in management. You were expected to get to work 20 minutes before your shift started to set your whole station up which is unpaid time."

709," Toronto, ON ", 13 February 2019,Director,3.0,Scotiabank is Evolving,"Whether we like it or not, the new leadership group is working to instill a different culture, less focused on employee development and support and far more on the bottom line (no longer be ""overly collegial"") . There are positives to both cultural mindsets and I doubt that shareholders are unhappy with the results posted since the change in top leadership at our bank. For many long-serving Scotiabankers the changes are drastic and include many lay-offs and reduced staffing in many departments with the bank looking to automation to offset reductions in the workforce. There are still lots of opportunities to learn and advance: I believe you could have 20 careers with the bank and still not touch half of what the bank does."

Managers only focus on their own growth rather than the team's or Bank's growth. Pathetic pay and even worse distribution of work. Workplace culture is a huge discrimination between permanent and contractual employees. On bad weather days, all there employees are told to leave early except contractors...why?...are we not human. They don't include you in any team meetings, emails, training sessions and then later expect you to know and do everything."

Zero training or assistance.  Hard work not appreciated, too much focus on unimportant details and not on the actual work.  Inexperienced supervisors who feel their title is more important than the work and effort of their direct reports.  Came in with a ton of optimism, left feeling an enormous sense of relief that I don't have to go back. Liked the work, hated the environment.  I truly wish I had nicer things to say, but learned that it is hard to work in an environment where everything you do is under a microscope and the value of your work is not appreciated."

Some of the employees can get away with doing the bare minimum while some do not which i think speaks to ho w certain managers will favour others. There is not really any benefits to working here, dealing with sometimes very rude customers and closing at midnight isn't that fun.

773," Scarborough, ON ", 24 December 2018,Customer Service Officer,1.0,Not for everyone,Work life balance is not good for those who are single parents. First 3 weeks of training are ok but the last 2 weeks  in podding was a very horrible experience. One of those factors that contributed to this is their archaic system that was useful in the 1980’s but it’s 2018!  This has hindered me with becoming prepared as a CSO. One of the SME’s who worked alongside us in Podding was swearing and uttering negative remarks which further made my experience negative. The final straw was when I received my pay cheques. The first pay was low and I sent an email to HR asking for clarification to which they never responded; then after I received my second pay it was 200 dollars lower than my first pay cheque. If they can’t treat their employees with respect how are we supposed to treat our customers?! As I am writing this I am still seeking employment elsewhere as I can’t afford to quit until I find another career. They lied to me about what my salary would be annually and I didn’t get the truth until 2 weeks into training. I will not recommend anyone who has bills to pay and children to feed to work here because you will struggle. Very unprofessional and stuck in the dark ages when it comes to the system we have to use to work with our customers. We all deserve better. Working on my exit as soon as I can.

Thats just how the job is everywhere. what makes it great is the amazing people, building, recreation and relaxation rooms, cafeteria, and constant contests and fun activities they keep doing to keep employee moral and motivation up since everyone knows that the front line and even the management jobs can be tough and boring. I miss it there actually. I would be surprised if a week passed by without any birthday cakes, or samosa sales or sale competition where you would actually win gift cards and rewards on top of your annual bonuses.  the Collections department specifically has very low morale. no perks. no extra bonuses or motivation to work harder. you feel like a drone. the work is not hard. its a bit dry but thats ok. its the people who need some lifting up. Professionalism here, even in managers, is lacking. dressing is atrocious! sometimes it looks like people rolled off the bed and walked to work! it looks like you're working in an agency and not a bank at all. it is very discouraging. most managers though, they leave you to do your job if you're doing good. and provide decent coaching if you need help. But usually they do not micromanage which is amazing."
779," Stratford, ON ", 19 December 2018,ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICER LEVEL 4,5.0,Great Job to have.,I enjoyed my time at the Bank. Learned a lot of great skills and the people you work with become like a work family. I would recommend working for this company.

I would recommend it as a great place to work. Hard to say what a typical day is like.  As a director, every day is different.  Every division is different and every department is different. Thanks."
788," Vancouver, BC ", 14 December 2018,Risk Analyst,2.0,Scotiabank Compensation Leaves Us Wanting,"The work environment is positive as well as the work/life balance. However, compensation is really lacking and not competitive in today's job market. Annual increases were just given and our group received 2%. Annual inflation in BC as of Oct 2018 was 3%, so in real terms, we will be making 1% less next year, than we did this year. A couple years back, defined benefit pension plans were phased out in favor or the riskier and less favorable defined contribution plans. Corporate year-end holiday parties ended. All this while the bank continues to make record profits each year. The main point is that the salary the bank pays is not competitive to what other non-bank companies will pay for the same position. And this is just down to the fact that they are so big and that the priority is always to the shareholders over anything else. But hey, that's big business for you!"

We put in our 8 hours and typically didn't stress about work until the next day.  A very healthy balance. That's no longer the case - the transformation that the bank has undergone has changed the corporate culture.  Nobody is safe.  We've seen many, many trusted and esteemed people leave for retirement or ""other opportunities"", friends have been laid off, and those who remain are overworked and stressed out.  There does not appear to be any respite coming - the new normalcy is having more work than hands to do it.  40 hour weeks are a thing of the past.  And the biggest rub: bonus pools and benefits are shrinking.

889," Sarnia, ON ", 10 October 2018,Management,2.0,Loved my job and clients,"Scotiabank is changed so much, from when i started there. I loved all my job, staff, and clients. But all the changes to our retirement/pension plan has forced a lot of excellent dedicated workers to leave before they wanted to. Perhaps they should go back to the old ways and be more dedicated to there staff that has been so loyal to them. They cannot get the staffing they need for branches today, but retirees cannot come back and work for them? Other banks allow their retirees to comeback. Or perhaps they should’ve grandfathered their longtime staff, so staff with 25 year or more that planned their retirement based on the old rules could’ve stayed and not forced out due to changes in the new plans and loss of benefits as of 2021."

894," Calgary, AB ", 8 October 2018,Senior Financial Advisor,4.0,"Good people, spotty management","I enjoyed my time at Scotiabank, even as the culture changed from a customer focus to a ""let's sell them everything"" focus.

896," Toronto, ON ", 3 October 2018,Quality Assurance Officer,3.0,staff are great - management needs to be replaced,"its a decent company to work for but there is no support from management. the turnover rate is high and they do not value the senior members on the team. upper management has no clue on what they want to do for the current fiscal year. one month, they want to focus on customer satisfaction then the next month, they want to focus on tangible statistics. they don't offer any formal training and expect your peers to train you instead. very minimal support from the direct team lead when new and more efficient ideas are presented to assist with the ridiculous workload assigned each month. the key agents on the team have all left and moved on yet the holes left have not been filled and the remaining agents are asked to pick up the slack. i would not recommend to work in the Canada Collections division of Scotiabank however, from what i've been hearing from former co-workers working in other areas of the bank now, they are much happier and they are actually getting paid what they are worth."

I did not fit into the ""clique"" created by certain managers and quickly realized I wanted to move on. It all seemed really fake. Some managers acted like they were your friend and talked behind your back. Lots of office drama and flirting, some affairs which I witnessed and wanted no part of keeping secrets. Toxic in my option. Hours were not great and expectations were high for such low pay. I was promised more hours but told No time and time again when I wanted to move forwards in my training- was in school at the time. Thought it would be good place to start. You would think at a bank, pay would be better- but not even managers make much money."

If you're willing to move and be mobile the possibilities are endless for hard workers. Management is great, from my experience. They truly care for each individual employee and are dedicated to doing whatever necessary to get each employee working at their peak performance. Job culture is so diverse everyone is made to feel welcome, accepted, and understood. I have so much great stuff to share and nothing bad to say, Scotiabank is a great company!"

915," Toronto, ON ", 24 September 2018,Adjustment Officer,3.0,Management is very condescending,"A solid 9-5, will expect you to be at your desk before start time. Management is extremely rude and condescending. If you are literally 1 minute late from your break expect to get yelled at. You will be counting your seconds. The people you work with are generally nice. Depends which department you get placed into. When (not if) you are moved from one department to another, expect no recognition for your prior accomplishments - no matter how hard you work. You will not be given technical support if your systems have issues, no matter how far you escalate, or how many times you ask management for support. Everybody is here for their next promotion."

923," Brockville, ON ", 19 September 2018,Customer Service Representative,3.0,"Great ""Grown Up"" Job","I feel that the bank could be a great place to work if you were more interested in looking out for the bank rather then the customers. The policies and procedures is miles and miles long, and it takes longer to learn the job then your probation period. You have to be adaptable and have thick skin. You also have to be able to say no quite regularly. As a relatively new hire, I was only given someone to teach me for two weeks, and after that management was very hard to come by for answers, unless you've made a mistake, then they would be sure to let you know. There's ""job aids"" that are available on the computer system, but you have to know what the title of it would be to effectively find it. It makes for a very long process if you have a customer waiting. I enjoy the customer aspect of this position  and I feel that's probably it."

If you have spent a lifetime honing your skills, working hard to be a dependable member of a team; don't waste your time here.  The management makes this extremely difficult, at least where I am.  I have found the management at Scotia to be incompetent and disrespectful.  They subscribe to dirty politics and distrust of others.

We are always considered in the wrong and not doing enough. They have zero trust in their employees and we are made to feel incompetent. Questionable requests have been made by upper management (all verbally because they would be in trouble if anyone had proof) such as telling us we are no longer able to book off new vacation for the foreseeable future because we are ""short staffed"". We are short staffed because Scotia has cut a ridiculous number of personnel and are squeezing every ounce of energy out of those that are left. Overworked, no one in our group has taken a lunch break in nearly a year.  We often are told by management and upper management that we are wasting the bank's time and do nothing.  Constantly felt we are being spied on by management and are constantly under the microscope. The atmosphere feels very much like a ""boys club"" and although they preach about gender equality and representation in the work place, if you look at those employed in upper management and as executives... you can see that equality and representation is clearly lacking. Certain employees are able to get away with huge transgressions whereas others are held on a much tighter leash. Seriously, everyone in our larger area hates it here. My recommendation to upper management would be to stop trying to squeeze every ounce of energy and  money out of your employees by overworking them and belittling them. Happy employees - more..."
949," Edmonton, AB ", 28 August 2018,Sr. Financial Advisor,5.0,Good Organization,"Very detailed oriented goals, hard to achieve, Management is not at all employee friendly focussed on hard core sales through a different objective.

Conduct morning shows and then you are done by putting all pressure to employees."

952," Toronto, ON ", 25 August 2018,Senior Recruitment Consultant,1.0,Horrible Experience,"My first 6 months as a Sr. Recruiter was splendid. I did an amazing job, and was recognized for it by my colleagues and leaders. Unfortunately for me, I reported to a new manager after my 6 months and she was very green to the banking world. Her lack of knowledge, and inability to understand my role and client group resulted in tension between us. Without a performance improvement plan and without warning she fired me. I absolutely couldn't believe it. I have since left the recruitment industry as a cause of this experience. It has mentality disabled me from my profession, a profession which I was very successful in for 5 plus years, a profession that has provided me a 6 figure salary as a Recruitment agent and multiple recommendations on linked from hiring managers, clients and candidates. On another note, Recruiting for Scotiabank was very heavy on the admin side during my time as a Sr. Recruiter and there is a lack of communication between the various groups in HR and lack of direction overall. I would not recommend a role as a Recruiter for Scotiabank to anyone in my network.. Horrible place for the Recruiter who enjoys building relationships and staying away from transactional environments."

For the most part I was lucky enough to work with some amazingly positive and helpful people. The management however needed a lesson in reality. When it comes to goals, pressure tactics only make people jump ship...not work harder. If you are ever concerned about a detail with your banking NEVER ask for a manager. They know about 10% of what the rest of the employees know. Instead, ask for an employee that has been at that particular location or even with the company for more than 10 years.

They help you when you are having a hard time, they give you cheers when you are doing a good job, they celebrate not only holidays and birthdays but your everyday little achievement with you.For anybody in the customer service indusrty, dealing with customers are always the hardest part of the job no matter what you do or where you are. You are dealing with people who's having a bad day, regular customer who's been doing exactly same transaction once every week, someone who's new to town, somebody who just won lottery, someone who was in a good mood but became upset after visitng the bank...etc. However, from my experiences I learned that you can give excellent service by remembering your customers or trying to get to know them.

This is after bothering them time and time again to help you, but they always seem to be too busy, until its time to power trip and give you a lecture.  Management doesn't seem to move up through positive work and challenging themselves and others to make the workplace better, but through sucking up to whomever is above them in the chain.  Upper management waltz's in acting like someone they're not. Generally trying to act like some sort of ""alpha male"" in a fancy looking suit, even though these suits that boost their confidence are no more than average church goers suit, LOL.  Cutbacks also destroyed morale in the culture. Employee's there for their entire lives that everyone took a liking to were given a package and told to get out as their job would be centralized. Only causing chaos and non competent employees would take on these additional tasks so corporate could save money on the more expensive long time employees.  Inter-company communications are also horrible. If you ever need anything or have questions above your branch you will be passed around dozens of different departments all the while waiting on hold for a minimum of 30 minutes each transfer.  They give you a contract with your set hours, and I definitely intended to do well and work above those hours. The ridiculous part is that you're - more..."

However when it comes to helping out customers or potential customers where all the T's don't cross and match up like a high net-worth client it can be frustrating because it's almost as if the credit department or underwriters who are deciding not he deal don't like to think outside fo the box and come up with a creative solution or they turn down your proposal for a solution.

That is the most frustrating part. but the bank is a good company to work for interim's of getting your regular paycheck and not having to worry about not getting paid on time or your benefits.

I work at a branch that tends to be slower and doesn't have as much foot traffic which means meeting the sales targets requires constantly digging for opportunities and never taking a moment for granted.  * The best part of my job, I enjoy helping people. I have personally helped some of my clients purchase their first home,car,luxury boat, cottage etc. I have also helped clients start a savings strategy for their children to ensure their college tuition would be paid for. The satisfaction that comes from someone trusting you with their future is rewarding."

These days it seems like there is always something new afoot; these changes are often greeted with varying levels of enthusiasm from my co-workers but I do my best to try and be a cheerleader for change.  The time that I have spent with my organization has taught me to listen and when in doubt, ask questions as ambiguity and assumptions often lead to mistakes. I believe that great customer service begins with listening. If a customer needs to vent their frustrations (within reason) sometimes it is necessary to let them. In the end, we must hear what they are saying and respond sincerely and helpfully. My job is about more than simply posting transactions correctly; in order to be REALLY good at my job, I need to offer sound and reasonable advice and solutions that help the client get ahead financially and leave them with peace of mind.  Management within my organization...management is a difficult job and there are some individuals that are better suited to it than others. My co-workers make my job feel less like work. I feel that we are a great team, we look out for each other and try to help out wherever we can. These people are without a doubt the most enjoyable part of my job.  The hardest part of my job is dealing with difficult clients. For some, everything is ""urgent"", must be done ASAP. This does not always gel well with the banking world as we must follow compliance protocols, - more..."

Management had an open door concept to ensure their staff, they were always available for any concerns or questions that they may have.

Correspondingly, they have many openings for green people who expect low pay but provide long-time working hours and lowest quality services to clients.

It is okay at first if you want to use it as a stepping stone however advancement within can be a bit tedious.  1. The system used is a bit outdated. It is so old school and that you have to learn to navigate the system in 1 week and then afterwards take live calls. 2. Not enough numbers of computers for use during training. Hence you need to buddy up with someone. Sometimes the trainer is lazy and he/she expects that after reading the manual you are going to be an expert in navigating the system. 3. You have to be mindful of whatever you say or do (even if it is a joke) during your probationary period. ""They"" may be offended by it and this will result in an immediate termination of your contract. I have personally seen people sent home during training for supposedly having conduct that is not within their parameters and they find ""offensive"". 4. People come and go quite frequently. You will see new faces on the floor almost every month.  5. Sooner or later you will feel like a robot with what you are doing.  6. There are certain things that the branch does which is not inline with the process of the customer contact center (vice versa) 7.

I worked in 5 different branches during my 4 years there, progressively working my way up through the sales roles. I can't believe how political the company is. Many of the people in upper management don't  deserve their positions at all. There is such great disconnect between them and the retail branches. Also, Scotiabank is notorious for paying much less than its competitors, and the benefits are not as competitive. For example, everyone's base pay is based off the average ""market reference"" for a similar job in the industry. I didn't know a single person who made the market reference or anywhere near it, and that is just the industry average. The closest I got is when I went to the extent of getting a competitor offer, and then trying to get them to match it. I only got 95% of the market reference. The last year was horrible and the drastic changes they made during the ""One Customer One Bank"" caused almost 100% of the sales team at my branch to quit, along with many other branches, which also negatively effects the customers. The amount of people who have gone on long-term disability and have taken early retirement due to the working conditions is scary. The pressure and stress to pay ratio the bank is putting on its employees just isn't right. However, on the bright side they are so desperate to hire new sales members that it's a great ""in"" to Financial Service and anybody who sticks around for a year or two can quickly move up within the branch because there are constantly openings due to people leaving. I did work - more..."

The offer a great training program, and weeks worth of the on the job training, Also, they continue to train their employees on a continuous bases which is why I rate this company a 75/100. The other 25 percent can be divided into 3 other categories that need improvement. First, would be that the Salary could be better considering the revenue the bank generates, as well as comparing top paid earners to average earners, typical of a bank or large corporation. Secondly, advancement is given to those who fit the culture and not necessarily on the best fit for the job. Schooling and education isn't looked at as important. Thirdly, management doesn't recognize, or least management I was under doesn't recognize employees strong suits and only focuses on the weak suits someone has. Based on the HBR (Harvard Business Review) books and articles, great leaders focus on people's strengths since its much more difficult to take someone's weak points and make them great, whereas if you focus on someone strong points you can make them 10x more effective then strictly focusing on their weak points. The most enjoyable part of the job I found was my peers and co workers.

2278," Toronto, On ", 16 February 2015,Financial Advisor,1.0,Terrible Place to work at,"I went through 3 months of training at Scotia Bank and found that unlike what everybody thinks this organization lacks transparency and guidelines as to how trainees are supposed to be dealt with. Trainees are disrespected and are dealt with as if they are there to help out with Micky Mouse tasks like buying things from grocery shops and help move stuff around the branch. So called co-workers don't even say hello to the trainees and treat them with disrespect. And if the trainee objects to the situation he is blamed for objecting. I worked at 2 other major banks and had never seen anything as shameful as this bank. Nobody bothers to teach you anything and your in branch coach is always busy with other things and yet you are expected to learn everything on your own and they will make sure they will be there to criticize you as soon as you do something that doesn't please them. Pay is lower than competitors and work environment is terrible. There is constant pressure on the Financial Advisors to sell and achieve targets to the point of madness. All kind of psychological and sales techniques are used to force the customer to open an account or buy an investment product. Customers are tired of going through all of this pressure as soon as they walk into the branch. Overall, there is a lot of competition between co-workers and management is only interested in numbers and not the quality of interaction with the customers. If you are wise enough you don't put your career in their hands."

For example, I am a new employee and was thrown on to live calls with real customers, dealing with their live accounts, while in training. I was not comfortable with that at all. Coming in from being unemployed and knowing how sensitive an issue money is to alot of people, that was very surprising.  I now help support the loans and mortgages department, which I took because I needed the full time hours/salary. If I had known the training would have just been one week, three days of which, were spent reading manuals and having MAYBE one hour of computer ""play time"" to learn processes and procedures, I might have stayed in the entry level role a little longer to get used to the system, which is VERY outdated.  The workload is not very ""employee friendly"". Not that I'm at work to breeze by, but there is something to be said about making the employees happy by not treating them like dogs and just expecting them to take hours upon hours of calls, back to back to back, without room to leave a note on a customers account. Our time is counted against us by the minute, even if we take a 10 second breath between calls, which goes against our statistics, which goes against our merit increase. That's just one of the measures that we have to compete with.  I feel that if Scotiabank was to really look at how they do things, they would see that they would need to; 1.

There is nothing worse than telling the person on the other end of the phone, especially if they've been on hold for some time, that you can't help them.

Definitely the most enjoyable part of my job was knowing I did my best each day, and tomorrow I got to do it all over again, with a few twists, with some great co workers.

I am frequently solicited by management to make sales presentations due to my high product knowledge. I routinely participate at numerous charitable events throughout the year also. Despite my active involvement in the community and excellent sales track record, many of my colleagues and I have not been happy to work for Scotia for many years now. Below are some of the reasons: - Employees are expected to work late to meet job demands. Overtime policies, such as requirements to secure approval before working extra hours, make it difficult for employees to get paid.  - It has a very poor record-keeping system for overtime. - Unpaid overtime has been a complaint from employees working in all provinces - Some branches pay employees overtime while others do not. Management denies it. - Employee salaries are well below the average in the industry, despite record sales. Some competing banks offer up to $10,000.00 more a year for candidates with the exact same qualifications and position. - Being short staffed is a common problem at most branches due to its high turn over rate. - Administrative support staff in branches are being eliminated making the overwhelming job demands even worse and increasing the long unpaid work hours. - The focus on sales is tremendous.
